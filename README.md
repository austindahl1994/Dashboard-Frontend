# Dashboard App
Frontend react SPA for a Dashboard application as a larger full stack project for portfolio 

## LEAVING OFF
1. Change home page and login to not look terrible
2. Navbar to be a context instead? Each widget has it's own version of a navbar, standard Dashboard home/close button at top, but rest is custom
3. UPDATE NAVBAR, ALWAYS SHOWING, TAKING UP SIDE OF PAGE INSTEAD OF HIDDEN, can close it still

### THOUGHTS
1. Use of refreshToken for axios instance
2. Update error handling for more accurate errors from backend
3. Update CSS for all widgets
4. Implement ErrorBoundry, lazy loading, and JSDoc for currently implemented widgets and going forward
5. CSS for mobile first going forward with widgets
